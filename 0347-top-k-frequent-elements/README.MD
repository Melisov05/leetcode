In this problem I decided to use counting array, since the array is not big and constraints allow us to use it.

To work with negative numbers I decided to shift the array by the possible amount of negative numbers. Thus n negative numbers correspond to first n idices in the array
after that I count the frequency using counting array. After we finished counting
we use our heap to get the k most frequent numbers.
